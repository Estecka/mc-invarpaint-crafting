# Invariable Paintings: Crafting Recipes

This addon for [Invariable Paintings](https://modrinth.com/mod/invariable-paintings) contains the experimental crafting recipes that have since been removed from the base mod.

This was republished separately for legacy purposes. In the future, it will either receive considerable change, or stop being maintained completely.
I'm still seeking feedbacks on how the current recipe feels. Even if you decided not to use them, I'd like to hear about it: [Google Form](https://forms.gle/2FMYYCYBEKTqXysv8)

Different recipes presets are provided as built-in datapacks; each provides varying degrees of crafting freedom. You can manage them in the datapack menu when creating a new world, or using the `/datapack` command in already created worlds. None of these packs are enabled by default. 


## Cloning
Paintings can be duplicated in the same way you would a banner or a book, bye placing an empty one and a fileld one together in a crafting grid.

I am considering adding additional materials as cost (similarly to armour trims), but I'm not sure what expensive materials would feel appropriate. Suggestions are welcome.


## Crafting with dyes
### General rules
Filling a painting is done by combining it with one or more dyes of different colours. The colour of the dyes has no particular meaning. The correspondance between each combination and variant is semi-random; it will vary depending on the set of paintings you have installed, but should remain the same for a given set.

In most presets, the resulting painting is obfuscated until you take it out of the crafting table.

### Provided datapacks:
Only one of these presets can be enabled at a time.

- **Unbound:** The least restrictive crafting pack. Paintings can be crafted using any amount of dyes, using either a blank painting or an already filled one. This is the only pack were crafting results are not obfuscated.

- **Expensive:** Crafting costs 8 different dies, and only accept Blank paintings as ingredients.  

- **Iterative:** Crafting only requires a single dye, thus only 16 different variants can be crafted from a blank canvas. More variants can be crafted by reusing filled paintings as ingredients. This will work better with more painting variants installed into the game.

- **Recycling:** The most restrictive crafting pack. Blank paintings cannot be used as ingredients, making it impossible to craft filled paintings solely from raw materials. Your only option is to recycle another one acquired through other means. This will work better with cloning disabled.
